Taxi Booking

You are going to book a taxi. There are infinite number of points 1, 2, 3... on the 
X axis and your current position is cur. There are N Taxis near you, and the position of those 
taxis is given as an array pos. Where pos[i] denotes the position of the ith taxi. You are also given an array time. 
Where time[i] denotes the time taken by the ith taxi to cover 1 unit of distance. 
Your task is to find the minimum time to board a taxi.

class Solution{
public:
    int minimumTime(int N,int cur,vector<int> &pos,vector<int> &time){
        int res=INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
            res=min(res,abs(pos[i]-cur)*time[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
